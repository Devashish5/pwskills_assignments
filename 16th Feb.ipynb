The data in common databases is modeled in tables, making querying and processing efficient. Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing.\n",

    "### 1- SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational.\n",
    "### 2- SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.\n",

    "### 4- SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.\n",
