    "\n",
    "# 2- Resource Sharing: Using shared resources makes it easy to communicate and synchronize between threads within the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3- Simplified Code: Threads simplify the design of concurrent programs, especially for I/O-bound tasks, since they run asynchronously, allowing other tasks to be executed while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",

    "# 4- Responsive GUI: By using threads in GUIs, you can ensure that the main event loop remains responsive while background processing performs time-consuming tasks.\n",

    "# 2- Race Conditions and Deadlocks: Managing shared resources among threads can be complex and lead to race conditions and deadlocks if synchronization mechanisms are not used correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3- Debugging Complexity: Multi-threaded programs can be difficult to debug due to non-deterministic behavior and race conditions.Limited CPU Utilization: Because of the GIL, CPU-bound tasks don't benefit significantly from threading because multiple threads can't efficiently utilize multiple CPU cores.\n",
